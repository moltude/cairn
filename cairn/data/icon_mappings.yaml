# =============================================================================
# Cairn Icon Mappings (CalTopo ↔ OnX)
# =============================================================================
# This file is intended to be:
# - Easy to inspect in code review
# - Safe to edit manually
# - Validated by unit tests / CI
#
# Notes:
# - CalTopo symbols are treated case-insensitively; keep keys lowercase.
# - OnX icon names are case-sensitive (match OnX export values).

policies:
  # If an OnX waypoint icon cannot be mapped to a CalTopo marker symbol,
  # Cairn will use `onx_to_caltopo.default_symbol` and append the original
  # icon name to the CalTopo description.
