"""DEPRECATED: This module has been split into multiple files.

This file is kept temporarily for reference but is no longer importable.
Python will prefer the package directory `cairn/tui/edit_screens/` over this file.

All functionality has been moved to:

- cairn.tui.edit_screens.shared - Shared utilities and EditContext
- cairn.tui.edit_screens.widgets - Custom input widgets
- cairn.tui.edit_screens.overlays - Container-based overlay classes
- cairn.tui.edit_screens.modals - ModalScreen-based modal classes

All imports should continue to work via the new package structure:
    from cairn.tui.edit_screens import EditContext, ColorPickerOverlay, etc.

This file will be removed in a future version.
