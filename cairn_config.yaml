# =============================================================================
# Cairn Icon Mapping Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This file maps CalTopo symbols to OnX Backcountry icons.
#
# HOW IT WORKS (in priority order):
#   1. symbol_mappings - matches CalTopo marker-symbol field
#   2. keyword_mappings - searches title/description for keywords
#   3. Default: "Location" icon (blue pin)
#
# TIPS:
#   - Generic symbols (point, marker, pin) are automatically ignored
#     so keyword matching can work for those waypoints.
#   - Keywords are case-insensitive and match anywhere in the text.
# =============================================================================

# Add icon type prefix to names (e.g., "Hazard - Avalanche Zone")
use_icon_name_prefix: false

# Track symbols without mappings (shows report after conversion)
enable_unmapped_detection: true
