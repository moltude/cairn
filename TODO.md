A dumping ground for ideas, known bugs and functionality I need to implement

1. Review and standardize mechanisms for interaction
  - Not all buttons respond to mouse click and they should
  - Need to decide on whether to use more buttons in general
  - Identify where enter works and where it doesn't

2. Chosing the file export directory still feels a little wonky. Need to have a move obvious way of interacting which
    may be a tree view.

3. Lose the 'file-prefix' for saving the file. The file name should be the file name.

4. Add a feature to include the CalTopo Folder name in either the Name or Ddescription for all elements.

5. Support for polygons/areas

6. Update README.
  - Split out even remotely technical bits into a seperate document
  - Quick start at the top

7. Test migrating CalTopo GPX to onX GPX

8. Cleanup notes for waypoints in migration. The only thing that should be included by default is the literal text of 'notes='. We may build in a --debug property to include those additional properties at some point.
    name=Sick bowl brah
    notes=
    id=312e3b9a-5325-4559-a302-ac53ef9e9186
    color=rgba(8,122,255,1)
    icon=Ski Touring

9. Styling
  - Increase the font size of 'Folder' name on all screens
